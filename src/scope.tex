\pnum
This document describes requirements for implementations of an
interface that computer programs written in the \Cpp programming language can
use to invoke algorithms with parallel execution. The algorithms described by
this document are realizable across a broad class of
computer architectures.

\pnum
There is a possibility of a subset of the functionality described by this
document being standardized in a future version of \Cpp, but it is not
currently part of any \Cpp standard. There is a possibility of some of the
functionality in this document never being standardized, or of it being
standardized in a substantially changed form.

\pnum
The goal of this document is to build widespread existing
practice for parallelism in the \Cpp programming language. It gives
advice on extensions to those vendors who wish to provide them.
