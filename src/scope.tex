\pnum
This Technical Specification describes requirements for implementations of an
interface that computer programs written in the \Cpp programming language may
use to invoke algorithms with parallel execution. The algorithms described by
this Technical Specification are realizable across a broad class of
computer architectures.

\pnum
This Technical Specification is non-normative. Some of the functionality
described by this Technical Specification may be considered for standardization
in a future version of \Cpp, but it is not currently part of any \Cpp standard.
Some of the functionality in this Technical Specification may never be
standardized, and other functionality may be standardized in a substantially
changed form.

\pnum
The goal of this Technical Specification is to build widespread existing
practice for parallelism in the \Cpp standard algorithms library. It gives
advice on extensions to those vendors who wish to provide them.
