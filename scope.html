<cxx-clause id="parallel.scope">
  <h1>Scope</h1>
    <p>This Technical Specification describes requirements for implementations of an
    interface that computer programs written in the C++ programming language may
    use to invoke algorithms with parallel execution. The algorithms described by
    this Technical Specification are realizable across a broad class of
    computer architectures.</p>
    
    <p>This Technical Specification is non-normative. Some of the functionality
    described by this Technical Specification may be considered for standardization
    in a future version of C++, but it is not currently part of any C++ standard.
    Some of the functionality in this Technical Specification may never be
    standardized, and other functionality may be standardized in a substantially
    changed form.</p>
    
    <p>The goal of this Technical Specification is to build widespread existing
    practice for parallelism in the C++ standard algorithms library. It gives
    advice on extensions to those vendors who wish to provide them.</p>
